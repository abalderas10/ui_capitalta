      content: (
        <>
          Agentic AI refers to autonomous tools that proactively take on tasks like bug fixes, tests, and environments setup—far beyond just
          answering prompts. By 2025, over 60% of enterprises are expected to implement such systems, reducing manual overhead by nearly
          40%.

      content: (
        <>
          Leading tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Tabnine, Codeium, and Replit are advancing from simple code suggestions to
          full-featured assistants. For example, Copilot’s “Agent Mode” can analyze and update multiple files, run tests, and propose PR
          self-summaries.
          <br />
          These tools let developers express tasks in natural language and receive production-ready code with error-handling, documentation,
          and compliance baked in.
          <br />
          AI tools now assist with architecture design—suggesting microservice boundaries, API schemas, and performance modeling. In
          parallel, Edge AI enables real-time analytics in IoT and autonomous environments
