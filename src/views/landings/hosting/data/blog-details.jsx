          The Test stage involves gathering feedback from real users on your prototypes. This is an iterative process where you refine your
          solutions based on user feedback. Testing helps you identify what works, what doesn&apos;t, and why.
          <br />
          Example: You test your financial app prototypes with a group of target users. Through usability testing sessions, you gather
          insights on their preferences, pain points, and overall experience. Based on this feedback, you iterate and improve the app.
